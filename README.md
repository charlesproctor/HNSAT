# 🛡️ Home Network Security Audit Tool (HSNAT)

A Python tool for scanning and auditing devices on your home or small office network. It detects open ports, enumerates services, checks for known vulnerabilities (CVEs), and highlights weak credentials — all through a GUI built with CustomTkinter.

---

##  Features

-  **Network & Port Scanning**: Uses `nmap` to discover live hosts and open ports.
-  **Service Detection**: Identifies running services and software versions.
-  **CVE Lookup**: Fetches known vulnerabilities from the [NVD API](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities), with:
  - CVE ID
  - Description
  - CVSS severity and score
  - Suggested remediation
-  **Weak Credential Scanning**: Attempts default/common credentials using `Hydra`.
-  **Geolocation**: Displays estimated location and ISP info using external IP data.
-  **Network Map Visualization**: Interactive map of devices and their topology.
-  **Reports**: Generates HTML and JSON reports for auditing and tracking.
-  **Offline Mode**: Skip CVE checks for air-gapped or firewalled environments.
