# üõ°Ô∏è Home Network Security Audit Tool (HSNAT)

A Python tool for scanning and auditing devices on your home or small office network. It detects open ports, enumerates services, checks for known vulnerabilities (CVEs), and highlights weak credentials ‚Äî all through a GUI built with CustomTkinter.

  - CVE ID
  - Description
  - CVSS severity and score
  - Suggested remediation
-  **Weak Credential Scanning**: Attempts default/common credentials using `Hydra`.
-  **Geolocation**: Displays estimated location and ISP info using external IP data.
